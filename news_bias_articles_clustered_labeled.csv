immigration,The Blaze,2025-08-08 20:20,"Anti-ICE, pro-George Floyd sheriff arrested for allegedly extorting weed company",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sheriff-extortion-arrest-ice-floyd,"Suffolk County Sheriff Steven Tompkins of Massachusetts is accused of extorting a cannabis company to have privileged access to investment opportunities, according to federal prosecutors.

Tompkins, 67, was arrested in Florida on two counts of extortion. He faces 20 years in prison if found guilty, in addition to a possible $250,000 fine and three years of supervised release.

'What the sheriff saw as an easy way to make a quick buck on the sly is clear-cut corruption under federal law.'

Tompkins allegedly used his position to pressure the unnamed marijuana company to allow him to purchase stock in the company before it went public. Initially, his $50,000 investment grew to be valued at $138,000, but afterward it tumbled, and he then demanded the company refund his money.

The indictment included screenshots of five checks made out to Tompkins to refund the money, but they were falsely labeled as ""loan repayments"" in order to obscure the extortion scheme.

""What the sheriff saw as an easy way to make a quick buck on the sly is clear-cut corruption under federal law,"" said Ted E. Docks of the Boston FBI.

The sheriff made headlines in October when he ended an agreement to house detainees for Immigration and Customs Enforcement after two decades. He said at the time that ending the contract would allow the department to offer more services for women.

""Our gender-specific programming, which is among the best in the country, allows us to address these issues, which include domestic violence, sexual exploitation, and substance use disorders, to name a few,"" Tompkins said.

He also joined a kneeling protest in 2020 to show solidarity with activists protesting about the death of George Floyd.

Tompkins' arrest is leading some to question how the extortion scheme could have continued under the nose of Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell, a Democrat.

Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance executive director Paul Diego Craney issued a statement excoriating Campbell in the wake of the arrest.

""Sheriff Tompkins allegedly used his public office to shake down a cannabis company for personal gain, and the only reason we know about it is because federal law enforcement stepped in. Where was Attorney General Andrea Campbell? How does a sitting sheriff commit years of misconduct right under her nose?"" reads the statement from Craney.

“This is a law enforcement official allegedly abusing a re-entry jobs program to line his own pockets. It's disgraceful and even more disgraceful that the state's top law enforcement officer didn't catch it,"" he added.

""While Andrea Campbell has been busy taking junket trips to Paris and suing the federal government over any and all actions they take, a sheriff was allegedly cashing in right in her own backyard. Her priorities are completely out of step with the basic job of holding public officials accountable,"" Craney continued. ""Why does it always take federal prosecutors to clean up corruption in Massachusetts? Andrea Campbell owes the public an explanation.""

Campbell similarly opposed ICE and the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts in comments made in November.

immigration,Breitbart,2025-08-09 00:00,"ICE HOUSTON: 350 Criminal Alien Gang Members with 1,400 Deportations, 1,700 Crimes",https://www.breitbart.com/border/2025/08/09/ice-houston-350-criminal-alien-gang-members-with-1400-deportations-1700-crimes/,"United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Houston arrested more than 350 illegal alien gang members during the first six months of the Trump administration. The group of violent offenders has cumulatively been convicted of nearly 1,700 crimes.

According to ICE, the group of foreign gang members illegally entered the United States 1,434 times, with one member of the group accumulating 40 illegal entries into the country alone, according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas from the Houston Enforcement and Removal Operations team. Among the criminal aliens arrested were convicted murderers, child predators, thieves, and arsonists.

The arrests in the area surrounding Texas’s largest city highlight what the agency says is its focus on arresting and removing the “worst of the worst” criminal illegal aliens. The agency has touted the arrests of violent offenders recently through social media posts and recent press releases highlighting high-profile offenders.

Acting Field Office Director for the Houston ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Gabriel Martinez commented on the arrests saying, “Despite attempts by some to undermine the courageous work being done by our officers, the brave men and women of ICE continue to put their lives on the line every day to arrest violent transnational gang members, foreign fugitives and dangerous criminal aliens.”

Martinez emphasized the danger the criminal gang members pose to the community, adding, “In just the past couple of years in Houston, transnational gang members were responsible for brutally raping and murdering an innocent 12-year-old girl on her way to the store. Our officers know their efforts can help prevent atrocities like that from every occurring again and they won’t rest until they’re all gone.”

Among the gang members arrested by ICE in the Houston area over the past six months were:

Milton Alexander Magana Fuentes, a 31-year-old child predator and Paisas gang member from El Salvador, arrested July 2. He has illegally entered the U.S. four times. While illegally in the U.S., Magana Fuentes has been convicted of sexual indecency with a child, failure to register as a sex offender, illegal reentry and illegal entry.

Ronald Alberto Rivas-Aguilar, a 28-year-old MS-13 gang member from El Salvador, arrested July 21. He illegally entered the U.S. twice and has been convicted of homicide.

Humberto Romero Avila, a 45-year-old Paisas gang member from Mexico, arrested Jan. 31. He illegally entered the U.S. 10 times. On Feb. 13, ICE deported Romero Avila to Mexico, where he was wanted for homicide. While he was in the U.S., Romero Avila was convicted of four DWIs, as well as larceny, illegal reentry and illegal entry.

Jonathan Josue Valle-Moralez, a 31-year-old previously deported MS-13 gang member from El Salvador, arrested Feb. 24. He’s been convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm. On March 6, ICE transferred Valle-Moralez into the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service to be prosecuted for homicide.

Jose Angel Martinez, a 39-year-old child predator and Paisas gang member from Mexico, arrested May 7. He illegally entered the U.S. five times and has been convicted of sexual indecency with a minor, aggravated assault of a family member, resisting arrest, burglary, drug possession and obstructing police.

Gerardo Ortega-Contreras, 43-year-old previously deported Tango Blast gang member from Mexico, arrested June 26. He has been convicted five times for resisting/evading arrest, four times for DWI, three times each for obstructing an investigation and burglary; twice for hit-and-run, and once each for drug possession, assault and larceny.

Jose Pizano-Tierrablanca, a 33-year-old Surenos-13 gang member from Mexico, arrested April 8. He illegally entered the U.S. four times and has been convicted of sexual indecency with a minor and illegal entry.

Samuel Valenzuela Martinez, a 55-year-old Paisas gang member from Mexico, arrested July 7. He illegally entered the U.S. five times and has been convicted six times for DWI, three times each for assault and illegal entry, and once each for hit-and-run, larceny, cruelty toward a child, evading arrest, fraud and illegal reentry.

The illegal aliens taken off the Houston streets were members of more than 40 different criminal gangs. The group included 39 MS-13 gang members, 25 Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members, 159 Paisas gang members, 12 Surenos-13 gang members, and 26 Tango Blast gang members. Other well-known gangs represented in the group include the Latin Kings and the 15th Street gang.

According to ICE, the 1,685 criminal convictions were for a wide variety of offenses, including abduction, homicide, sexual assault, sexual assault of a child, promotion of child pornography, aggravated assault, domestic violence, burglary, alien smuggling, sex trafficking, organized crime, drug trafficking, drug possession, arson, trespassing, unlawful possession of a firearm, illegal entry, illegal reentry, fraud, escape and evading arrest.

immigration,Breitbart,2025-08-09 00:00,ICE: ‘Trump Burger’ Owner Facing Deportation for Overstaying His Visa,https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/08/09/ice-trump-burger-owner-facing-deportation-for-overstaying-his-visa/,"The Lebanese immigrant who owns several Trump-themed restaurants in the Houston, Texas, area may be deported due to allegedly overstaying his visa, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said.

Twenty-eight-year-old Roland Beainy of the “Trump Burger” restaurants was supposed to leave the country by early February 2024 after arriving in 2019, KHOU reported on Thursday.

However, he is accused of overstaying his visa and an ICE spokesperson said he does not have immigration benefits to prevent officials from arresting and deporting him.

“On May 16, he was arrested and put into immigration proceedings. On June 13, an immigration judge granted his request for bond while he waits for the proceedings to unfold,” the article said.

The burger chain that opened in 2020 has four locations, according to the New York Post. The outlet said, “The restaurant also sued its Kemah, Texas, landlord, Archie Patterson, in June, alleging he forced staff out and took control of the location, according to the Houston Chronicle. Patterson, however, accused Beainy of unpaid debts in his own lawsuit.”

The Post report cited a statement from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that said federal officials “revoked” his petition for immigration status after relatives claimed his marriage was “a sham designed to game the system.”

DHS said it will not tolerate immigration fraud, adding, “This person has no Green Card, a history of illegal marriages, and an assault charge. DHS is actively pursuing all legal avenues to address this flagrant abuse of our immigration laws.”

The news comes as the Trump administration is cracking down on illegal immigration in communities and workplaces across the United States.

Per Click 2 Houston, an ICE statement regarding Beainy’s case said:

Despite false claims to the contrary, Roland Mehrez Beainy does not have any immigration benefits that prevented his arrest or removal from the United States. Beainy is a 28-year-old illegal alien from Lebanon who entered the United States in 2019 as a non-immigrant visitor, but he failed to depart by Feb. 12, 2024, as required under the terms of his admission. ICE officers arrested him on May 16, 2025, and he was placed into immigration proceedings. On June 13, an immigration judge granted his request for bond while he undergoes his proceedings. Under the current administration, ICE is committed to restore integrity to our nation’s immigration system by holding all individuals accountable who illegally enter the country or overstay the terms of their admission. This is true regardless of what restaurant you own or political beliefs you might have.

In January, Beainy said he was a huge Trump supporter, adding, “He’s a gentleman that makes peace. Even before he took office, he made peace in the Middle East already between Lebanon and Israel.”",37.73,62.87,49.65,49.03,28.41,conservative,81.32,1,Unbiased

On Wednesday night, the adult cartoon ripped into the Trump administration yet again, this time targeting JD Vance and right-wing podcast bros. But the episode’s harshest ridicule was directed at none other than Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who is depicted as a wine-guzzling, Botox-loving, puppy-killing, tyrant as the leader of ICE. (The show spends much time ruthlessly skewering the agency, too.)

The episode, in its specific way, holds a comedic mirror to our cruel reality: ICE’s desperate recruitment efforts, an administration hellbent on disappearing immigrants without due process, and “torture.”",39.73,76.88,27.68,94.52,79.21,liberal,11.92,1,Unbiased
immigration,MSNBC Latest,2025-08-08 18:56,‘Essence of racial profiling’: ICE’s L.A. rental truck raid may have violated court orders,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/immigration-raid-los-angeles-home-depot-trump-deportations-rcna223883,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 7 episode of “The Briefing with Jen Psaki.”

Here’s a headline you might not have expected from the Los Angeles Times: “ICE arrests plummet in L.A., data show.” Over the past month, immigration arrests in the seven counties around Los Angeles have fallen to about half of what they were the previous month — and experts say there’s a simple reason for that.

Bass ordered city officials to investigate whether the immigration agents violated that court order barring them from racial profiling.

Last month, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to stop arresting suspected undocumented immigrants based solely on their race, ethnicity, language and the type of work they do — otherwise known as racial profiling. That meant the Trump administration had to stop randomly showing up at worksites and arresting people with no criminal history.

But then on Wednesday, something changed. Video from the MacArthur Park area of L.A. shows federal agents loading themselves into a rented moving van. According to the Los Angeles Times, that truck drove to a Home Depot and “pulled up to laborers who had gathered in the parking lot. The driver told them in Spanish he was looking for workers.”

That’s when federal agents spilled out and started chasing after those laborers, ultimately arresting 16 people. The L.A. Times reported that one of the people detained in the raid was a woman wearing an apron who had been selling food and drinks from a folding table.

The Department of Homeland Security suggested that this raid was targeting MS-13 gang members, but, as the Times noted, agents appeared to arrest only day laborers and street vendors, who are often extorted by the gangs.

Local officials in Los Angeles have said Wednesday’s operation looks a lot like the kind of racial profiling raids that the courts explicitly told ICE they could no longer conduct in Southern California. The city’s mayor, Karen Bass, questioned the federal government’s claim that the immigrants targeted in this raid were “gang members” and asked authorities to share any evidence they had to prove so. Bass described the raid as the “essence of racial profiling” and ordered city officials to investigate whether it violated the July court order.

Meanwhile, on Thursday, the Trump administration decided to take a new approach. In a new court filing, they asked the Supreme Court to overturn that judge’s order and let them please go back to profiling as many brown, Spanish-speaking day laborers as they want.

The government’s filing reads, in part: “Needless to say, no one thinks that speaking Spanish or working in construction always creates reasonable suspicion. Nor does anyone suggest those are the only factors federal agents ever consider. But in many situations, such factors — alone or in combination — can heighten the likelihood that someone is unlawfully present in the United States.”

That is a pretty unbelievable statement. The federal government is saying it should be able to consider “speaking Spanish or working in construction” alone when determining whether to arrest someone on suspicion of being undocumented.

To sum this all up: Donald Trump’s immigration officers have engaged in widespread racial profiling to sweep up immigrants throughout the Los Angeles area. A court ordered them to stop. Then, federal agents appeared to just start doing it again, arresting day laborers and street vendors in what officials said looks like racial profiling. And now the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to make it all OK.",21.7,75.4,20.75,76.89,13.3,liberal,6.51,0,Liberal
immigration,MSNBC Latest,2025-08-08 16:32,Trump administration seeks Supreme Court’s help on latest immigration enforcement efforts,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-supreme-court-los-angeles-immigration-enforcement-rcna223828,"The Trump administration turns, once again, to the Supreme Court for quick help in carrying out executive actions that lower courts have halted for their apparent illegality. At issue in the latest outing are the so-called roving patrols by immigration authorities in central California.

A federal district judge ruled last month that individuals and groups who sued the government would likely succeed in proving that the administration is “conducting roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and denying access to lawyers.” U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong said the government can’t rely on the following factors to make stops: apparent race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or English with an accent; presence at a particular location, such as a bus stop, day laborer pickup area or agricultural site; or one’s type of work.

Last week, a three-judge panel of Democratic-appointed judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit refused to halt the Biden appointee’s order.

Approving the factors laid out by Frimpong, the panel observed that apparent Hispanic or Latino race or ethnicity has limited relevance in this context, because large numbers of native-born and naturalized citizens have such physical characteristics, especially in central California. The judges further noted that many people who are lawfully in this country speak Spanish or accented English. They likewise downplayed any suspicious nature to being at a particular location or working a certain job, citing Supreme Court precedent on the Fourth Amendment.

In its emergency application to the Supreme Court, the administration conceded that “no one thinks that speaking Spanish or working in construction always creates reasonable suspicion.” But U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote that “in many situations, such factors — alone or in combination — can heighten the likelihood that someone is unlawfully present in the United States.” Sauer complained that immigration agents can’t detain people based on those factors “even after encountering someone who speaks only Spanish and works as a day laborer at a worksite that has been cited 30 times for hiring illegal aliens as day laborers.”

As the administration has done throughout President Donald Trump’s second term, Sauer casts the latest litigation as yet another instance of the justices needing to check their lower court colleagues. “When lower courts have tried to stymie other areas of immigration enforcement with unlawful, blunderbuss injunctions, this Court has not hesitated to stay those orders,” he wrote, citing recent examples of the high court siding with the administration (over dissent from Democratic-appointed justices).

Against that backdrop, Sauer is pleading with the justices to free the administration from what he called the “straitjacket on law-enforcement efforts.” How the court handles the request could indicate whether the justices agree with that dramatic framing, or whether they see that claimed confinement as a consequence of the Constitution rather than defiance of it.
